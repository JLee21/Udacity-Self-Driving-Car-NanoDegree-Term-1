## Camera Calibration

### Compute Camera Matrix and Distortion Cooefficients
Below is an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The location of the calibration images used are stored in this repository's directory `cal-images`
 ![]()

## Image Pipeline
Every image must undergo a undistortion step as preceding steps require or assume no distortion from the inherent nature of the camera lenses is induced. In order to undistort each image the following code is used (cell block ` `)

Below is an example of distorion corrected image that is part of the driving video.
